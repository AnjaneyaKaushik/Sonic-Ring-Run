# Sonic Runner

A fast-paced, endless runner game featuring Sonic the Hedgehog. This project is built using JavaScript and the [Kaplay](https://kaplayjs.com/) game engine, a modern fork of Kaboom.js.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to run as far as possible, collecting rings and avoiding enemies to achieve a high score.

-   **Endless Level:** The game procedurally generates an endless path for Sonic to run on.
-   **Collect Rings:** Gather rings to increase your score.
-   **Avoid Enemies:** Jump over or on top of classic Sonic enemies like Motobug and Buzz Bomber.
-   **Scoring:** Your score increases with each ring collected (+2 points) and enemy defeated (+10 base points). Chaining enemy jumps applies a score multiplier.
-   **Score Checkpoints:** Reach certain scores (50, 250, 450, 500, 700, 1000) to earn bonus lives, but only when you have less than 3 lives and haven't exceeded the 3-life bonus limit.
-   **Ring Streak System:** Collect rings consecutively for bonus points - 5+ rings give +3 points each, 10+ rings give +5 points each with special effects.
-   **Perfect Run Bonuses:** Achieve 20+ consecutive actions without damage for score bonuses, or 30+ for a bonus life (when below 3 lives).
-   **Streak Rebuild System:** Get multiple chances to rebuild broken streaks with decreasing preservation rates.
-   **Increasing Difficulty:** The game's speed gradually increases over time, making it more challenging.

## Controls
-   **Jump:** `Spacebar` / `Left Mouse Click` / `Touch`

## Pause Screen

You can pause the game at any time by pressing the `ESC` key or clicking the pause button on the top right of the screen. The pause screen displays the following information:

-   **Current Score:** Your score in the current run.
-   **High Score:** Your best score achieved across all runs.

To resume the game, press the `ESC` key again or click the resume button.

## Score Checkpoints

The game features a strategic life recovery system through score checkpoints:

-   **Checkpoint Scores:** 50, 250, 450, 500, 700, 1000 points
-   **Bonus Lives:** Earn +1 life when reaching these milestones
-   **Smart Recovery:** Lives are only awarded when you have less than 3 lives
-   **Limited Resource:** Maximum of 3 bonus lives can be earned per game session
-   **Audio Feedback:** A satisfying "ding" sound plays when a bonus life is awarded
-   **Visual Indicator:** Green "+1 LIFE!" message appears above Sonic

### How It Works:

1. **Start with 3 lives** ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
2. **Take damage** ‚Üí 2 lives ‚ù§‚ù§
3. **Reach checkpoint** ‚Üí +1 life ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ (if under 3 total bonus lives)
4. **Strategic play** required after using all 3 bonus lives

This system encourages recovery gameplay while maintaining the challenge by limiting total bonus lives.

## Streak & Combo Systems

The game features advanced streak mechanics that reward consistent play and create addictive gameplay loops:

### Ring Streak System:
-   **Building Streaks:** Collect rings consecutively without taking damage
-   **Streak Bonuses:** 
    -   5-9 rings: +3 points each with "COMBO!" display
    -   10+ rings: +5 points each with "STREAK!" + bonus audio
-   **Visual Feedback:** Golden streak counter shows current progress

### Perfect Run System:
-   **Perfect Actions:** Any ring collection or enemy defeat without taking damage
-   **Milestone Rewards:**
    -   20+ actions: +50 bonus points + "PERFECT RUN!" display
    -   30+ actions: +100 bonus points + bonus life (only when below 3 lives)
-   **Strategic Value:** Encourages risk-taking for massive rewards

### Streak Rebuild System:
When you take damage, the game offers multiple chances to preserve your streaks:

1.  **Second Chance (First Damage):**
    -   **Requirement:** 5+ ring streak OR 10+ perfect run
    -   **Result:** Keep 50% of current streaks
    -   **Message:** Orange "SECOND CHANCE! REBUILD!"

2.  **Last Chance (Second Damage):**
    -   **Requirement:** 3+ ring streak OR 5+ perfect run
    -   **Result:** Keep 30% of current streaks
    -   **Message:** Red "LAST CHANCE! FINAL REBUILD!"

3.  **No Mercy (Third Damage):**
    -   **Result:** Complete streak reset
    -   **Message:** "STREAK BROKEN!"
    -   **Reset:** All rebuild chances refresh for next cycle

This system creates escalating tension and multiple opportunities for recovery while maintaining fair challenge.

## Scoring System

The game features a generous scoring system to help players reach higher grades and checkpoints:

### Point Values:
-   **Ring Collection:** +2 points per ring (base)
    -   **Ring Streak Bonuses:**
        -   5-9 rings: +3 points each ("COMBO!")
        -   10+ rings: +5 points each ("STREAK!" + bonus sound)
-   **Enemy Defeat:** +10 base points (with multiplier)
    -   **Enemy Chains:** Consecutive enemy defeats multiply the base score
        -   1st enemy: +10 points
        -   2nd enemy: +20 points (10√ó2)
        -   3rd enemy: +30 points (10√ó3)
        -   And so on...
    -   **Perfect Run Bonuses:**
        -   20-29 perfect actions: +50 bonus points
